Client config needs Managed=true

Need a single binaries dir for all build plugins (then we can use Discover)

In go-plugin, a plugin binary (server) can register multiple plugins
(interfaces), each with its own name. The Dispense RPC then provides these
plugins based on their name.

It's a bit of a different model from what we need for htmlize, where multiple
plugins can be registered for each interface - e.g. different role plugins.
We can encode it in the plugin name somehow: e.g. a content plugin registers
under "content", while role plugins register under "role:<name>". But this
means the plugin needs a way to tell the client which plugins are registered.
It would be nice if go-plugin's dispenseServer had this functionality, but it
doesn't. Maybe we should just add a special RPC for that.
